# CosmicQuery
---
CosmicQuery is an astronomical image analysis platform that combines interstellar feature-detecting technology with artificial intelligence to help you better explore and understand the cosmos. 

CosmicQuery is a webpage users can go to, whether it be with images taken by their own equipment, or downloaded from those far more grand orbiting the earth, and can learn about exactly what they are seeing. CosmicQuery takes users photos and runs them though plate solving and data acquisition astronomical libraries to determine known objects, features, and information about them from a database of over 20 million unique celestial objects. It then provides the user with the annotated image detailing notable features and, if present, what the central body of the image is. The user then has access to an AI astronomer partner aptly named "Astro" to elaborate further on facts about the contents of the photo, and answer any questions the user has. Rather than take this data from the wide internet immediately like most LLM's would, Astro takes the data directly from the SIMBAD astronomical database first to ensure scientific integrity.

Built solo for HackTX 25 - University of Texas at Austin's hackathon for 2025.
